# MPVTV

MPVTV is just a script to help you watch those sweet IPTV streams from all over the world.
Skip youtube and go back to regular commercial breaks.

This uses the [iptv](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv) collection as a source for the playlists.

## Usage

Simply run the script. No arguments no worry about, for now. Simple start and go.


```
mpvtv
```

## Install

Follow the install steps for mpv-iptv, this is necessary for it to work.

Create the mpvtv directory in your `.config` folder in your home directory.
Copy the `channel-lists` directory into it.


```
mkdir ~/.config/mpvtv
cp -r channel-lists ~/.config/mpvtv/
```

After that you can add the `mpvtv` script to your scripts folder or run it from where ever you want.
